**Robo Advisor for Retirement Investing with SPY and AGG**

This Python-based Robo Advisor is designed to assist users in planning and optimizing their retirement investment portfolios using a combination of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) and AGG (iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF). By remixing the investment weights between these two assets, the Robo Advisor aims to maximize returns while managing risk according to the user's preferences.

### Features:

1. **Amazon Lex Integration**: The Robo Advisor leverages Amazon Lex, a service for building conversational interfaces, to interact with users and gather information about their investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

2. **Lambda Function**: The core functionality of the Robo Advisor is implemented using AWS Lambda, which enables serverless execution of code in response to Lex bot interactions. This allows for efficient and scalable handling of user requests.

3. **Portfolio Optimization**: Based on the user's input, the Robo Advisor calculates the optimal allocation of funds between SPY and AGG to achieve the desired balance of risk and return. It employs modern portfolio theory principles to diversify the portfolio and minimize downside risk.

4. **Risk Assessment**: The Robo Advisor assesses the user's risk tolerance through a series of questions and adjusts the investment strategy accordingly. It aims to strike a balance between achieving higher returns and mitigating the potential for significant losses, based on the user's risk appetite.

5. **Retirement Planning Guidance**: In addition to portfolio optimization, the Robo Advisor provides guidance on retirement planning, including estimated future portfolio values, recommended contribution amounts, and potential retirement income streams.

### Getting Started:

1. **Set Up AWS Account**: To deploy and use the Robo Advisor, you need an AWS account with permissions to create and manage Lambda functions, Amazon Lex bots, and other necessary resources.

2. **Configure Amazon Lex Bot**: Create a new Amazon Lex bot and configure it to gather relevant information from users, such as investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Define the necessary intents and slot types to capture user input accurately.

3. **Implement Lambda Function**: Develop the Lambda function that serves as the backend for the Robo Advisor. This function should handle Lex bot interactions, perform portfolio optimization calculations, and generate personalized investment recommendations based on user input.

4. **Test and Deploy**: Thoroughly test the Robo Advisor to ensure its functionality and accuracy. Once validated, deploy the Lambda function and integrate it with the Amazon Lex bot. Make necessary adjustments based on user feedback and performance testing.

### Usage:

1. **Initiate Conversation**: Users can initiate a conversation with the Robo Advisor by interacting with the Amazon Lex bot through a supported interface, such as a chat window or voice interface.

2. **Provide Information**: The Robo Advisor will prompt users to provide information about their investment preferences, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Users should respond to these prompts honestly and accurately.

3. **Receive Recommendations**: Based on the information provided, the Robo Advisor will generate personalized investment recommendations, including the optimal allocation of funds between SPY and AGG, estimated future portfolio values, and suggested contribution amounts.

4. **Review and Adjust**: Users can review the recommendations provided by the Robo Advisor and make any desired adjustments before implementing the suggested investment strategy.
